## About this service

This is a free statistics service to help the tech community understand the reality of Javascript support in browsers

Whilst planning the redevelopment of [Econsultancy](http://econsultancy.com)'s research subscription product, I had to evaluate whether we could completely abandon support for browsers without support for Javascript. Whilst using [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org/) to build a rich user experience is certainly appealing, we genuinely have no idea how many of our users don't support Javascript and that worries me.

So I've taken the initiative to provide *Javascript only* analytics service for the tech community with the following in mind:

* Adding tracking to your site should be <b>simple</b>, and it is, go to the [track your site page](http://scriptstats.info/track-your-site)
* All tracking must be anonymous - I don't keep any user data whatsoever.  Transparency is key so the project is [Open Source](https://github.com/mattheworiordan/scriptstats/blob/master/LICENSE) and on [Github](https://github.com/mattheworiordan/scriptstats)
* Stats are collated at a global level as well as at a website level.  Every website owner can benefit for free whilst helping to contribute to the global index
* Stats are indexed by month so hopefully in time this website will serve as a relic to the complete demise of browsers without Javascript

Feel free to get in touch with me [Matthew O'Riordan](http://mattheworiordan.com/) if you have any questions or suggestions.
